Lead Fitness

A UI/UX project with free workout plans. 

This website was designed with the idea that maintaining physical fitness during quarantine is extremely important. It includes three separate workout plans designed for beginners all the way to advanced level fitness connoisseurs. The three plans are completely free to view and try out whenever is right for you. 
The look and color layout of the website was designed on Abode XD and built with HTML, CSS, and javascript with some occasional Jquery for functionality.
